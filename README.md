### Defining the Problem
A local businessman wishes to pruchase a computational system that would take over his manual process of recording the transactions in his car renting company. He usually records the features of his vehicles such as maker's name and model along with the number of passagers. Using separate ledgers he records the trips done by each rental. At the end of the month the owner calculates simple statistics such as average distance travel per car, total kilometers, and total number of trips. The owner has made some requirements for the system:
1. A simple terminal based program,
1. A simple and transparent installation,
1. Easy commands that allow to create a car, record a trip, query the trip history of a car, edit, and delete a car,
1. Easy commands that allow to enter the trip distance (km).
1. A basic permanent storage system and backup,
1. A command to see total statistics.
1. User-skill independent.
